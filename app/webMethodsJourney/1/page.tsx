                    <p className="text-white mb-8">When you step into an organization as a fresher, especially one that uses specialized technology like web methods, 
                    you're often thrown into the deep end 🌊. You might find yourself in a situation where you're expected to work on technologies you've never even heard of 🤯. 
                    This is a common scenario in service-based organizations like Cognizant, Accenture, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, and Tata Consultancies, among others 🏢</p>

                    <p className="text-white mb-8">Your team leader might assume you're already trained and ready to work on complex tasks 🤖. This assumption can lead to a lot of stress 😰 and confusion 🤷‍♂️, especially when you're not given the proper training or guidance. You might find yourself stuck, not knowing how to proceed or whom to ask for help 🆘</p>
                </li>
